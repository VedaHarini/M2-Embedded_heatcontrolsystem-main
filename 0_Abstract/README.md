The heat control system is used to control the temperature of the car seat. When a person gets seated on a car, the button sensor will be activated. After that, the user gets access to turn ON the heater. The temperature sensor keeps monitoring the temperature and sends the analog value to the microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the analog input of the temperature sensor and outputs a temperature value through serial communication. All the activities of the control system are done on a Atmega328 microcontroller.
